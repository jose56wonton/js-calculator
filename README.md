# Js-Calculator 

This is my 1st JS project. It is a calculator!

As my first project the main purpose was just to get the hang of using JS in my projects. 

This project can be found on my website [here](http://joshuawootonn.com/js-calculator/)!

This project is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) JS track.
The project itself can be seen [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript-and-jquery/lessons/on-screen-calculator)!
